# CategoricalNBFitOptions

## Properties

### X?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)

Training vectors, where `n\_samples` is the number of samples and `n\_features` is the number of features. Here, each feature of X is assumed to be from a different categorical distribution. It is further assumed that all categories of each feature are represented by the numbers 0, â€¦, n - 1, where n refers to the total number of categories for the given feature. This can, for instance, be achieved with the help of OrdinalEncoder.
