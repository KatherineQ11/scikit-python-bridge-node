# BaggingRegressorFitOptions

## Properties

### X?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)

The training input samples. Sparse matrices are accepted only if they are supported by the base estimator.

Defined in:  [generated/ensemble/BaggingRegressor.ts:493](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/scikit-learn-ts/blob/92ab806/packages/sklearn/src/generated/ensemble/BaggingRegressor.ts#L493)

### sample\_weight?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)

Sample weights. If `undefined`, then samples are equally weighted. Note that this is supported only if the base estimator supports sample weighting.

Defined in:  [generated/ensemble/BaggingRegressor.ts:503](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/scikit-learn-ts/blob/92ab806/packages/sklearn/src/generated/ensemble/BaggingRegressor.ts#L503)

### y?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)

The target values (class labels in classification, real numbers in regression).

Defined in:  [generated/ensemble/BaggingRegressor.ts:498](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/scikit-learn-ts/blob/92ab806/packages/sklearn/src/generated/ensemble/BaggingRegressor.ts#L498)
