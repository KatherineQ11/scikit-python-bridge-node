# KDTreeTwoPointCorrelationOptions

## Properties

### X?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)[]

An array of points to query. Last dimension should match dimension of training data.

Defined in:  [generated/neighbors/KDTree.ts:512](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/scikit-learn-ts/blob/92ab806/packages/sklearn/src/generated/neighbors/KDTree.ts#L512)

### dualtree?

> `boolean`

If `true`, use a dualtree algorithm. Otherwise, use a single-tree algorithm. Dual tree algorithms can have better scaling for large N.

#### Default Value

`false`

Defined in:  [generated/neighbors/KDTree.ts:524](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/scikit-learn-ts/blob/92ab806/packages/sklearn/src/generated/neighbors/KDTree.ts#L524)

### r?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)

A one-dimensional array of distances

Defined in:  [generated/neighbors/KDTree.ts:517](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/scikit-learn-ts/blob/92ab806/packages/sklearn/src/generated/neighbors/KDTree.ts#L517)
