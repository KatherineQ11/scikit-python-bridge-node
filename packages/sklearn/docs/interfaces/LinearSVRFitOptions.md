# LinearSVRFitOptions

## Properties

### X?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)

Training vector, where `n\_samples` is the number of samples and `n\_features` is the number of features.

Defined in:  [generated/svm/LinearSVR.ts:396](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/scikit-learn-ts/blob/92ab806/packages/sklearn/src/generated/svm/LinearSVR.ts#L396)

### sample\_weight?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)

Array of weights that are assigned to individual samples. If not provided, then each sample is given unit weight.

Defined in:  [generated/svm/LinearSVR.ts:406](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/scikit-learn-ts/blob/92ab806/packages/sklearn/src/generated/svm/LinearSVR.ts#L406)

### y?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)

Target vector relative to X.

Defined in:  [generated/svm/LinearSVR.ts:401](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/scikit-learn-ts/blob/92ab806/packages/sklearn/src/generated/svm/LinearSVR.ts#L401)
