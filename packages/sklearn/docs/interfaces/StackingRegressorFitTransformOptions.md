### X?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)

Training vectors, where `n\_samples` is the number of samples and `n\_features` is the number of features.

Defined in:  [generated/ensemble/StackingRegressor.ts:535](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/scikit-learn-ts/blob/92ab806/packages/sklearn/src/generated/ensemble/StackingRegressor.ts#L535)

### sample\_weight?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)

Sample weights. If `undefined`, then samples are equally weighted. Note that this is supported only if all underlying estimators support sample weights.

### y?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)

Target values.
