Set of samples, where `n\_samples` is the number of samples and `n\_features` is the number of features.

Defined in:  [generated/svm/OneClassSVM.ts:612](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/scikit-learn-ts/blob/92ab806/packages/sklearn/src/generated/svm/OneClassSVM.ts#L612)

### sample\_weight?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)

Per-sample weights. Rescale C per sample. Higher weights force the classifier to put more emphasis on these points.
