# KNeighborsRegressorScoreOptions

## Properties

### X?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)[]

Test samples. For some estimators this may be a precomputed kernel matrix or a list of generic objects instead with shape `(n\_samples, n\_samples\_fitted)`, where `n\_samples\_fitted` is the number of samples used in the fitting for the estimator.
