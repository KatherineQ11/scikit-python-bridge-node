# BernoulliNBPartialFitOptions

## Properties

### X?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)

Training vectors, where `n\_samples` is the number of samples and `n\_features` is the number of features.

Defined in:  [generated/naive\_bayes/BernoulliNB.ts:564](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/scikit-learn-ts/blob/92ab806/packages/sklearn/src/generated/naive_bayes/BernoulliNB.ts#L564)

### classes?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)

List of all the classes that can possibly appear in the y vector.

Must be provided at the first call to partial\_fit, can be omitted in subsequent calls.

### sample\_weight?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)

Weights applied to individual samples (1. for unweighted).
