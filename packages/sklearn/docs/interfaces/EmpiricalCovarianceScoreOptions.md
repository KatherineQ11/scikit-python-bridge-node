### X\_test?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)[]

Test data of which we compute the likelihood, where `n\_samples` is the number of samples and `n\_features` is the number of features. `X\_test` is assumed to be drawn from the same distribution than the data used in fit (including centering).
