# SpectralEmbeddingFitOptions

## Properties

### X?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)

Training vector, where `n\_samples` is the number of samples and `n\_features` is the number of features.

If affinity is “precomputed” X : {array-like, sparse matrix}, shape (n\_samples, n\_samples), Interpret X as precomputed adjacency graph computed from samples.
