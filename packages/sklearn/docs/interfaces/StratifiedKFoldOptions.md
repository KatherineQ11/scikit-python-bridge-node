# StratifiedKFoldOptions

## Properties

### n\_splits?

> `number`

Number of folds. Must be at least 2.

#### Default Value

`5`

Defined in:  [generated/model\_selection/StratifiedKFold.ts:168](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/scikit-learn-ts/blob/92ab806/packages/sklearn/src/generated/model_selection/StratifiedKFold.ts#L168)

### random\_state?

> `number`

When `shuffle` is `true`, `random\_state` affects the ordering of the indices, which controls the randomness of each fold for each class. Otherwise, leave `random\_state` as `undefined`. Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls. See [Glossary](../../glossary.html#term-random_state).

### shuffle?

> `boolean`

Whether to shuffle each classâ€™s samples before splitting into batches. Note that the samples within each split will not be shuffled.

#### Default Value

`false`

Defined in:  [generated/model\_selection/StratifiedKFold.ts:175](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/scikit-learn-ts/blob/92ab806/packages/sklearn/src/generated/model_selection/StratifiedKFold.ts#L175)
