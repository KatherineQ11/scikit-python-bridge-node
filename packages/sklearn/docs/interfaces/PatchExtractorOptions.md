# PatchExtractorOptions

## Properties

### max\_patches?

> `number`

The maximum number of patches per image to extract. If `max\_patches` is a float in (0, 1), it is taken to mean a proportion of the total number of patches.

Defined in:  [generated/feature\_extraction/image/PatchExtractor.ts:165](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/scikit-learn-ts/blob/b59c1ff/packages/sklearn/src/generated/feature_extraction/image/PatchExtractor.ts#L165)

### patch\_size?

> `any`

The dimensions of one patch.

Defined in:  [generated/feature\_extraction/image/PatchExtractor.ts:160](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/scikit-learn-ts/blob/b59c1ff/packages/sklearn/src/generated/feature_extraction/image/PatchExtractor.ts#L160)

### random\_state?

> `number`

Determines the random number generator used for random sampling when `max\_patches is not None`. Use an int to make the randomness deterministic. See [Glossary](../../glossary.html#term-random_state).

Defined in:  [generated/feature\_extraction/image/PatchExtractor.ts:170](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/scikit-learn-ts/blob/b59c1ff/packages/sklearn/src/generated/feature_extraction/image/PatchExtractor.ts#L170)
