This project is not affiliated with the [official Python scikit-learn project](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html). Hopefully it will be one day. ðŸ˜„

All of the difficult machine learning work happens under the hood via the [official Python scikit-learn project](https://scikit-learn.org), with full credit given to their [absolutely amazing team](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html). This project is just a small open source experiment to try and leverage the existing `scikit-learn` ecosystem for the Node.js community.
