# PipelinePredictOptions

## Properties

### X?

> `any`

Data to predict on. Must fulfill input requirements of first step of the pipeline.

Defined in:  [generated/pipeline/Pipeline.ts:606](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/scikit-learn-ts/blob/122b3c0/packages/sklearn/src/generated/pipeline/Pipeline.ts#L606)

### predict\_params?

> `any`

Parameters to the `predict` called at the end of all transformations in the pipeline. Note that while this may be used to return uncertainties from some models with return\_std or return\_cov, uncertainties that are generated by the transformations in the pipeline are not propagated to the final estimator.
