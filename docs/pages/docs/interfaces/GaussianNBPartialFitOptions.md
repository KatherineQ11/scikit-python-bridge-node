# GaussianNBPartialFitOptions

## Properties

### X?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)[]

Training vectors, where `n\_samples` is the number of samples and `n\_features` is the number of features.

### classes?

> [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md)

List of all the classes that can possibly appear in the y vector.

Must be provided at the first call to partial\_fit, can be omitted in subsequent calls.
